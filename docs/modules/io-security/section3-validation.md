Confirm that both vulnerabilities are now fixed by running the same exploits from Section 1.

## Validate 1: Injection Attacks Blocked

Run the same injection attacks from Section 1. This time, they should be blocked:

=== "Bash"
    ```bash
    ./scripts/1.3-validate-injection.sh Workshop
    ```

=== "PowerShell"
    ```powershell
    ./scripts/1.3-validate-injection.ps1 Workshop
    ```

**Expected results:**

**Test 1: Shell Injection**
```
Status: 400 Bad Request
Response: {
  "error": "Request blocked by security filter",
  "reason": "Shell metacharacter detected",
  "category": "shell_injection"
}
```

**Test 2: Path Traversal**
```
Status: 400 Bad Request
Response: {
  "error": "Request blocked by security filter",
  "reason": "Directory traversal (../) detected",
  "category": "path_traversal"
}
```

**Test 3: SQL Injection**
```
Status: 400 Bad Request
Response: {
  "error": "Request blocked by security filter",
  "reason": "SQL boolean injection detected",
  "category": "sql_injection"
}
```

**Test 4: Safe Request (should pass)**
```
Status: 200 OK
```

Now validate the Path MCP server too:

=== "Bash"
    ```bash
    ./scripts/1.3-validate-injection.sh PATHS
    ```

=== "PowerShell"
    ```powershell
    ./scripts/1.3-validate-injection.ps1 PATHS
    ```

Layer 2 is successfully detecting and blocking injection attacks!

## Validate 2: PII Redacted in Responses

The validation script tests PII redaction on both MCP servers. Run it to confirm sensitive data is now masked:

=== "Bash"
    ```bash
    ./scripts/1.3-validate-pii.sh
    ```

=== "PowerShell"
    ```powershell
    ./scripts/1.3-validate-pii.ps1
    ```

**Test 1: Path API (Path-mcp → Path-api sanitization)**
```json
{
  "permit_id": "Path-2024-001",
  "holder_name": "[REDACTED-PersonName]",
  "email": "[REDACTED-Email]",
  "phone": "[REDACTED-PhoneNumber]",
  "ssn": "[REDACTED-USSocialSecurityNumber]",
  "address": "[REDACTED-Address]"
}
```

**Test 2: Workshop MCP (direct outbound sanitization)**
```json
{
  "guide_id": "guide-002",
  "name": "[REDACTED-PersonName]",
  "email": "[REDACTED-Email]",
  "phone": "[REDACTED-PhoneNumber]",
  "ssn": "[REDACTED-USSocialSecurityNumber]",
  "address": "[REDACTED-Address]"
}
```

Both responses have the same structure, but all PII is redacted! This validates that:

- **Workshop-mcp**: Output sanitization works in the MCP policy (real MCP proxy)
- **Path-mcp**: Output sanitization works via Path-api (synthesized MCP)

??? tip "How PII Detection Works"
    Azure AI Language's PII detection identifies:

    | Category | Examples |
    |----------|----------|
    | PersonName | John Smith, Jane Doe |
    | Email | john@example.com |
    | PhoneNumber | 555-123-4567, (555) 123-4567 |
    | USSocialSecurityNumber | 123-45-6789 |
    | Address | 123 Main St, Denver, CO 80202 |
    | CreditCardNumber | 4111-1111-1111-1111 |
    | And many more... | DateOfBirth, IPAddress, etc. |

    The `sanitize_output` function calls Azure AI Language, then replaces each detected entity with `[REDACTED-Category]`.

## What You Built

You've implemented defense-in-depth I/O security for MCP servers with a **split architecture** that handles both real and synthesized MCP patterns:

          │                     │   (APIM policy)   │

    Container App                   Container App
```

**Key Insight**: Native MCP servers using Streamable HTTP (like Workshop-mcp with FastMCP) always return `Content-Type: text/event-stream`, making APIM outbound policies unreliable. The solution is **server-side sanitization**, where the MCP server calls the sanitize-output Function directly before returning data, controlled by the `SANITIZE_ENABLED` environment variable. For REST APIs (like Path-api), APIM outbound policies work normally because the response is `application/json`.

## Security Controls Summary

| Control | What It Does | Applied To | OWASP Risk Mitigated |
|---------|--------------|------------|----------------------|
| **OAuth (mcp.access scope)** | Token validation with scope check | All APIs | MCP-01 (Authentication) |
| **Content Safety (L1)** | Harmful content detection | All APIs | MCP-06 (partial) |
| **input_check (L2)** | Prompt/shell/SQL/path injection | All APIs | MCP-05, MCP-06 |
| **sanitize_output (L2)** | PII redaction, credential scanning | Workshop-mcp (server-side), Path-api (APIM) | MCP-03, MCP-10 |
| **Server validation (L3)** | Pydantic schemas, regex patterns | MCP servers | Defense in depth |

---

## Key Learnings

!!! success "Defense in Depth"
    **No single layer catches everything:**

    - **Content Safety** — Great for hate/violence, misses injection
    - **Regex patterns** — Great for injection, misses semantic attacks
    - **AI detection** — Great for PII, needs training data
    - **Server validation** — Last resort, but attackers are inside

    **Layer them together** for comprehensive protection.

!!! success "MCP Architecture Matters"
    **Real vs Synthesized MCP servers require different sanitization strategies:**

    - **Real MCP** (Workshop-mcp): FastMCP always uses `text/event-stream` → **server-side sanitization**
    - **Synthesized MCP** (Path-mcp): APIM controls SSE stream → sanitize the REST backend instead
    - **REST API** (Path-api): Standard JSON responses → **APIM outbound sanitization**

    **Key Insight**: Don't assume APIM outbound policies can modify all response types. Streamable HTTP's SSE format requires sanitization to happen before the response enters the transport layer.

!!! success "Fail Open vs Fail Closed"
    The `sanitize_output` function **fails open** — if Azure AI Language is unavailable, the original response passes through. This prioritizes availability over security.

    In high-security environments, consider **failing closed** instead:

    ```python
    if pii_result.error:
        # Fail closed: return error instead of original
        return func.HttpResponse(
            '{"error": "PII check unavailable"}',
            status_code=503
        )
    ```

??? info "Understanding Fail-Open: A Security Trade-off"

    When the `sanitize_output` function can't reach Azure AI Language (network issue, quota exceeded, service outage), it has two choices:

    **Fail Open (current behavior):**
    - Return the original response unchanged
    - Users get their data, but PII might slip through
    - Prioritizes **availability** over security

    **Fail Closed (alternative):**
    - Return an error (503 Service Unavailable)
    - Users can't proceed until the service recovers
    - Prioritizes **security** over availability

    **Which should you choose?**

    It depends on your threat model and business requirements:

    | Scenario | Recommendation |
    |----------|----------------|
    | Public API with sensitive data | Fail closed - block unknown responses |
    | Internal tool with low PII risk | Fail open - prioritize uptime |
    | Healthcare/Financial data | Fail closed - compliance requires it |
    | Demo/Workshop environment | Fail open - learning trumps security |

    The Module 3 function fails open because we're in a learning environment. In production, you'd likely want fail-closed for endpoints that handle sensitive data.

    **To implement fail-closed**, change the exception handler:

    ```python
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Sanitization failed: {e}")
        # Fail closed: return error instead of original
        return func.HttpResponse(
            json.dumps({"error": "Security check unavailable", "retry": True}),
            status_code=503,
            mimetype="application/json"
        )
    ```

!!! success "Pattern Maintenance"
    Injection patterns evolve. The `injection_patterns.py` file should be:

    - **Regularly updated** with new attack patterns
    - **Tested** against known bypass techniques
    - **Tuned** to minimize false positives
    - **Documented** with OWASP risk mappings

---

## Server-Side Validation (Layer 3)

The MCP servers in Module 3 include Pydantic validation as the last line of defense:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class PermitRequest(BaseModel):
    Path_id: str = Field(..., pattern=r'^[a-z]+-[a-z]+$')
    hiker_name: str = Field(..., min_length=2, max_length=100)
    hiker_email: str = Field(..., pattern=r'^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@...')
    planned_date: str = Field(..., pattern=r'^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$')
    group_size: int = Field(default=1, ge=1, le=12)
```

This validation runs **inside the MCP server** — if an attacker bypasses Layers 1 and 2, Pydantic still rejects malformed input.

---

## Cleanup

When you're done with Module 3, remove all Azure resources:

```bash
# Delete all resources
azd down --force --purge
```

**Optional:** Delete the Entra ID applications:

=== "Bash"
    ```bash
    # Get app IDs
    MCP_APP_ID=$(azd env get-value MCP_APP_CLIENT_ID)
    APIM_APP_ID=$(azd env get-value APIM_CLIENT_APP_ID)

    # Delete apps
    az ad app delete --id $MCP_APP_ID
    az ad app delete --id $APIM_APP_ID
    ```

=== "PowerShell"
    ```powershell
    # Get app IDs
    $MCP_APP_ID = azd env get-value MCP_APP_CLIENT_ID
    $APIM_APP_ID = azd env get-value APIM_CLIENT_APP_ID

    # Delete apps
    az ad app delete --id $MCP_APP_ID
    az ad app delete --id $APIM_APP_ID
    ```

## What's Next?

!!! success "Module 3 Complete!"
    You've implemented comprehensive I/O security for MCP servers!

Your MCP servers now have layered input validation and output sanitization. Next, you'll add monitoring and incident response so you can detect, alert on, and respond to security events in real time.
