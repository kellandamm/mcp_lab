"""Output Sanitizer Module

Calls the Azure Function sanitize-output endpoint to redact PII from responses.
The Function App uses anonymous authentication, so no managed identity is needed.

Sanitization is controlled by the SANITIZE_ENABLED environment variable:
- SANITIZE_ENABLED=false: Returns original text, no sanitization
- SANITIZE_ENABLED=true (default): Calls Azure Function to redact PII

Camp 4 has sanitization enabled by default since the focus is on monitoring,
not on demonstrating the exploit → fix → validate workflow.
